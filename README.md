# GravitySimulator
N-body simulator with 3d physics

Download and run the latest version of Cmake point to the src/ dir as the directory containing the source code. Create a dir for the project to build. I use GravitySimulator/bin and tell Cmake to build the binaries there. Unselect option BUILD_TESTING in the Cmake GUI.
